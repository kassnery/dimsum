You need to create a folder called "results" to run python scripts.
The C+- code was developed with Visual Studio 2015.
This code was developed by Ran Ben-Bassat, Gil Einziger, Roy Friedman and Yaron Kassner.
It is an extension of code by G. Cormode published here: http://hadjieleftheriou.com/frequent-items/index.html
Our additions to the code are the python scripts for evaluation (python/*), 
the implementation of the IMSum algorithm (src/alosum.*) and the implementation of the DIMSum algorithm (src/losum.*).
In addition, we have edited the hh.cc file to include evaluation for the added algorithms.
